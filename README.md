# Residual_Networks
<b><u> The problems of very deep neural networks </u> :-</b> <br>

The main benefit of a very deep network is that it can represent very complex functions. It can also learn features at many different levels of abstraction, from edges (at the lower layers) to very complex features (at the deeper layers). However, using a deeper network doesn't always help. A huge barrier to training them is vanishing gradients: very deep networks often have a gradient signal that goes to zero quickly, thus making gradient descent unbearably slow. More specifically, during gradient descent, as you backprop from the final layer back to the first layer, you are multiplying by the weight matrix on each step, and thus the gradient can decrease exponentially quickly to zero (or, in rare cases, grow exponentially quickly and "explode" to take very large values).<br>


## Building a Residual Network
Lets build residual network to classification of sign Language MNIST.<br>

In ResNets, a "shortcut" or a "skip connection" allows the gradient to be directly backpropagated to earlier layers:

The image on the left shows the "main path" through the network. The image on the right adds a shortcut to the main path. By stacking these ResNet blocks on top of each other, you can form a very deep network.

Two main types of blocks are used in a ResNet, depending mainly on whether the input/output dimensions are same or different. You are going to implement both of them.
### The identity block

The identity block is the standard block used in ResNets, and corresponds to the case where the input activation  has the same dimension as the output activation.To flesh out the different steps of what happens in a ResNet's identity block, here is an alternative diagram showing the individual steps

Here're the individual steps.

First component of main path: 
- The first CONV2D has F1 filters of shape (1,1) and a stride of (1,1). Its padding is "valid" and its name should be `conv_name_base + '2a'`. Use 0 as the seed for the random initialization. 
- The first BatchNorm is normalizing the channels axis.  Its name should be `bn_name_base + '2a'`.
- Then apply the ReLU activation function. This has no name and no hyperparameters. 

Second component of main path:
- The second CONV2D has F2 filters of shape $(f,f)$ and a stride of (1,1). Its padding is "same" and its name should be `conv_name_base + '2b'`. Use 0 as the seed for the random initialization. 
- The second BatchNorm is normalizing the channels axis.  Its name should be `bn_name_base + '2b'`.
- Then apply the ReLU activation function. This has no name and no hyperparameters. 

Third component of main path:
- The third CONV2D has F3 filters of shape (1,1) and a stride of (1,1). Its padding is "valid" and its name should be `conv_name_base + '2c'`. Use 0 as the seed for the random initialization. 
- The third BatchNorm is normalizing the channels axis.  Its name should be `bn_name_base + '2c'`. Note that there is no ReLU activation function in this component. 

Final step: 
- The shortcut and the input are added together.
- Then apply the ReLU activation function. This has no name and no hyperparameters.

### The convolutional block
â€‹
convolutional block is the other type of block. You can use this type of block when the input and output dimensions don't match up. The difference with the identity block is that there is a CONV2D layer in the shortcut path

The details of the convolutional block are as follows. 

First component of main path:
- The first CONV2D has F1 filters of shape (1,1) and a stride of (s,s). Its padding is "valid" and its name should be `conv_name_base + '2a'`. 
- The first BatchNorm is normalizing the channels axis.  Its name should be `bn_name_base + '2a'`.
- Then apply the ReLU activation function. This has no name and no hyperparameters. 

Second component of main path:
- The second CONV2D has F2 filters of (f,f) and a stride of (1,1). Its padding is "same" and it's name should be `conv_name_base + '2b'`.
- The second BatchNorm is normalizing the channels axis.  Its name should be `bn_name_base + '2b'`.
- Then apply the ReLU activation function. This has no name and no hyperparameters. 

Third component of main path:
- The third CONV2D has F3 filters of (1,1) and a stride of (1,1). Its padding is "valid" and it's name should be `conv_name_base + '2c'`.
- The third BatchNorm is normalizing the channels axis.  Its name should be `bn_name_base + '2c'`. Note that there is no ReLU activation function in this component. 

Shortcut path:
- The CONV2D has $F_3$ filters of shape (1,1) and a stride of (s,s). Its padding is "valid" and its name should be `conv_name_base + '1'`.
- The BatchNorm is normalizing the channels axis.  Its name should be `bn_name_base + '1'`. 

Final step: 
- The shortcut and the main path values are added together.
- Then apply the ReLU activation function. This has no name and no hyperparameters.
